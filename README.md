-- Hello everyone! My name is Aleksandr and I primarily focus on web development for now.
-- 
--
-- This project is about a to-do list which will combine both frontend, and backend, and database.
--
-- According to my plans, it will contain not a simple to-do list, but users
-- will also have an ability to register in their accounts and
-- interact with their tasks accordingly.
--
--
-- Hope you enjoy this! To-Do-List project is the first one where I actually use
-- git and combine frontend, backend, and database - which is a huge benefit to me.
